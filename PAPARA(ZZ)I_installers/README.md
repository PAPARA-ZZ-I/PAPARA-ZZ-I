This directory contains the executable files necessary to run PAPARA(ZZ)I on a 64-bit Windows, MacOS and Linux operating systems. If MATLAB 2015b is not already installed on the computer, the PAPARA(ZZ)I installer will automatically offer the option to install the MATLAB Runtime.

- 'WEB' package files install PAPARA(ZZ)I and download the MATLAB Runtime from the Internet (if not already installed).

- 'MCR' package files include both PAPARA(ZZ)I and the MATLAB Runtime (use this option if an Internet connection is not available).



IMPORTANT:

Due to the large size of the files, the MCR installers (i.e. the ones with MATLAB Runtime included) are not stored on GitHub. However, they can be downloaded from here:
